      <h4>Why we should eat more fibers?</h4>

			    <p>A new analysis of almost 250 studies confirmed on 
      a large scale that eating lots of fiber from vegetables, 
      fruits, and whole grains can decrease your risk of dying 
      from heart disease and cancer.</p>

<section class="2">
      <p> Those who ate the most fiber  reduced their risk of dying from cardiac disease</p>
      stroke, type 2 diabetes, and/or colon cancer by 16% to 24%, compared to 
      people who ate very little fiber. The study also concluded that 
      more fiber is better. For every additional 8 grams of dietary 
      fiber a person consumed, the risk for each of the diseases fell 
      by another 5% to 27%. Risk reductions were greatest when daily 
      intake of dietary fiber was between 25 and 29 grams.</p>

      <p>Two observational studies showed that dietary fiber 
        intake is also associated with a decreased risk of death from 
        any cause. Those eating the highest amount of fiber reduced 
        their risk of dying by 23% compared to those eating the least 
        amount of fiber. In these studies, the associations were more 
        evident for fiber from cereals and vegetables than from fruit.</p>

        /* Make a way to do coluns here! */

        <p>Weight control is another benefit of high-fiber diets. 
          By helping you feel full longer after a meal or snack, 
          high-fiber whole grains can help you eat less. In one large 
          study, adults who ate several servings of whole grains a day 
          were less likely to have gained weight, or gained less weight, 
          than those who rarely ate whole grains.</p>
