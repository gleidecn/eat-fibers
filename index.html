        <hr>
        <p> A new analysis of almost 250 studies confirmed on
          a large scale that eating lots of fiber from vegetables,
          fruits, and whole grains can decrease your risk of dying
          from heart disease and cancer.
          <br>
          <br>
          Weight control is another benefit of high-fiber diets.
          By helping you feel full longer after a meal or snack,
          high-fiber whole grains can help you eat less. In one large
          study, adults who ate several servings of whole grains a day
          were less likely to have gained weight, or gained less weight,
          than those who rarely ate whole grains.

          <hr>
          <p> Those who ate the most fiber reduced their risk of dying from cardiac disease
          stroke, type 2 diabetes, and/or colon cancer by 16% to 24%, compared to
          people who ate very little fiber. The study also concluded that
          more fiber is better. For every additional 8 grams of dietary
          fiber a person consumed, the risk for each of the diseases fell
          by another 5% to 27%. Risk reductions were greatest when daily
          intake of dietary fiber was between 25 and 29 grams.
