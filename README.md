    - Running the code on The W3C CSS Validation Service I was able to spot few erros:
    - Family names containing whitespace should be quoted. If quoting is omitted, any whitespace characters before and after the name are ignored and any sequence of whitespace characters inside the name is converted to a single space. 
   
    - I´ve also notice this erros:
        - Imported style sheets are not checked in direct input and file upload modes
        - So I´ve researched on [https://www.py4u.net/discuss/1074517] and founded this answer:
    - You're just trying to validate your CSS file using the W3C validator, and it's letting you know that it's not going to validate the imported style sheet (Google's). It's not an error, just some information for you.
    


## Unfixed Bugs

    - 


## Deployment

#### I've found very interesting the process of doing the deployment, very useful and helpful as well. I think it was great having the chance to expose my projects and my live website.

    - The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
